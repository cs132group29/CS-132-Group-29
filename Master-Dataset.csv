Aquino’s “Marcial Bonifacio” passport was a Philippine travel document. It was secured through the help of ex-Mindanao congressman Rashid Lucman, according to a 2003 Philippine Daily Inquirer article quoting Cory Aquino.

Hermes Dorado, former national territory division head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, claimed in 2013 that Aquino met with then-Malaysian Prime Minister Mohammad Mahathir. In the supposed meeting, which allegedly took place before Aquino returned to the Philippines from self-exile in the United States, the former senator told Mahathir that he would drop the Philippines’ claim on Sabah once in power, in exchange for Malaysia’s support to oust Marcos. Aquino was assassinated on his return on Aug. 21, 1983.

Dorado said he indirectly confirmed this piece of information from former ambassador and retired general Rafael Ileto. This claim could not be verified by documents or other accounts.

There is no official confirmation from China that the Aquino administration sold Scarborough Shoal.

The Aquino administration did lose effective control of the territory in April 2012 after a tense standoff with China. But following this loss, the Aquino administration challenged China’s 9-dash claim over the disputed territories in the South China Sea.

On Ninoy Aquino ‘selling’ Sabah
> This claim is unproven. Hermes Dorado, former national territory division head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, claimed in 2013 that Aquino met with then-Malaysian Prime Minister Mohammad Mahathir.
On Cory Aquino ‘selling’ the Philippine Airlines
> This needs context. Philippine Airlines (PAL) was privatized in March 1992, towards the end of Aquino’s term as president, although plans to sell the company were made years earlier. 
On Noynoy Aquino selling the Scarborough Shoal
> This is false. In 2012, the former president said former senator Antonio Trillanes IV was approached by Chinese officials to do backchannel negotiations with China in order to resolve tensions over Scarborough Shoal at the time.

Aquino was not present at the event as he was allegedly at a birthday party with Sen. Doy Laurel and his family in a nearby restaurant. But there’s no concrete evidence proving that his absence meant he was among those who planned the violent attack.
Until now, without any substantial basis, claims that Aquino was one of the plotters are merely unfounded rumors and not a historical fact. He was never linked to any concrete evidence or definite report or tagged by a witness.

Although some books do emphasize the narrative surrounding Ninoy Aquino and his family during the Martial Law period and post-EDSA, much of the literature cited also sheds light on the atrocities of the Marcos dictatorship, the majority of which were unseen and/or repressed during the height of Martial Law in the country. One of the books included, Robles’ Marcos Martial Law: Never Again (2016), contains official records, reports, eyewitness accounts, and interviews with survivors and military officers that give credence to the regime’s abuses.

Aquino, in a televised interview while in prison in March 1978, denied being a CIA agent. He, however, admitted that he had sometimes exchanged information with the agency and once carried out a secret mission to Indonesia during a “CIA-backed rebellion” there in 1958, as reported by the New York Times. Aquino justified it as part of his duties as a former government official.
While Sison recognized that Aquino was “not known to be hostile to the NPA,” he said there was “no formal alliance” between them.

In 2012, the Philippines recorded one of its strongest years for growth, surpassing all expectations; the first quarter GDP of 2013, recorded at 7.8%, further raised the bar among the community of nations and exceeding even our growth trend.

Aquino was not present at the event as he was allegedly at a birthday party with Sen. Doy Laurel and his family in a nearby restaurant. But there’s no concrete evidence proving that his absence meant he was among those who planned the violent attack. Until now, without any substantial basis, claims that Aquino was one of the plotters are merely unfounded rumors and not a historical fact. He was never linked to any concrete evidence or definite report or tagged by a witness.
