Former Senator Bam Aquino proposed Senate Bill No. 357 or the Zero Waste Food Bill, which hopes to reduce food wastage and address hunger by mandating restaurants and supermarkets to give unserved food — not leftovers — to food banks for distribution to poor Filipino families. In short, this bill will not give out ""pagpag"" or recycled food from garbage to poor Filipino families.

Aquino’s “Marcial Bonifacio” passport was a Philippine travel document. It was secured through the help of ex-Mindanao congressman Rashid Lucman, according to a 2003 Philippine Daily Inquirer article quoting Cory Aquino.

Hermes Dorado, former national territory division head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, claimed in 2013 that Aquino met with then-Malaysian Prime Minister Mohammad Mahathir. In the supposed meeting, which allegedly took place before Aquino returned to the Philippines from self-exile in the United States, the former senator told Mahathir that he would drop the Philippines’ claim on Sabah once in power, in exchange for Malaysia’s support to oust Marcos. Aquino was assassinated on his return on Aug. 21, 1983.

Dorado said he indirectly confirmed this piece of information from former ambassador and retired general Rafael Ileto. This claim could not be verified by documents or other accounts.

There is no official confirmation from China that the Aquino administration sold Scarborough Shoal.

The Aquino administration did lose effective control of the territory in April 2012 after a tense standoff with China. But following this loss, the Aquino administration challenged China’s 9-dash claim over the disputed territories in the South China Sea.

One passport was under Aquino’s real name, while the other was under the alias “Marcial Bonifacio,” Ampeso said. 

Aquino’s “Marcial Bonifacio” passport was a Philippine travel document. It was secured through the help of ex-Mindanao congressman Rashid Lucman, according to a 2003 Philippine Daily Inquirer article quoting Cory Aquino.
